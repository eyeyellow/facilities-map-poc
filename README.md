# U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service GIS Facilities Map Proof-of-Concept

This is just me playing around with the public API for [FWS National Visitor Service Amenities](https://gis-fws.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/fws-national-visitor-service-amenities-view/geoservice) dataset.

It's currently hard-coded to the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge's org code (`31521`).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.1.
